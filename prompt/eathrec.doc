I want you to build an amazing and highly professional functional and dynamic webApp for me with react and tailwind css for frontend and nodeJS, expess and mongoDB and integrate this two together i want a completed fully and functioning application.
Here is the goal of the application. It a carbon sequestration tracking application where farmer get registered and register their algae farm land, and get cardon credit yield. And verifier are the people that verifies a registered farm land.
I want the webApp supper responsive and amazing (green is the brand color), and ensure notification and popping correctly based on actions on the platform.

Here is the frontend description:
1. Farmer Registration and login page: Where Farmer register(Username, Email, wallet_address(optional), password and confirm password) and login with only wallet_address or (Username or email and password). 
2. Verifier Registration(must first be a farmer before geting the verifier role): where a user(farmer) register to get the verifier role: registration info: (select one of the two(NIN number or Voter card ID), Phone number, active mail, image)
3. Dashboard: Where any users are redirected to after registration, This display the statics of the entire platform and the user involvement as well. For the entire platform display info: Total farmer, Total Verifier, Total landmass, Total carbon yield. And button to Add a new farm, and for the user to be a verifier (if just a farmer).  Under this wanna display the list of all farms on the platform(with status Approved, and updated). With filters for users to filter by (recent, date range, hierarchy in terms of high to low or low to high based on yield and landmass respectively. And a search bar to search a farm. Farm list cards display: (farm image, name, landmass, cardon credit yield, Registration No(Their Id no), Registration Date, farmer username) and at the top right of the card i wanna display the farm tag(Active (if farm status is Approved) or On-check (if farm status is Updated) )
4. Add a new farm: form with this field(Farm business name, Country, farm address, Land mass:(lenght input, width input), Is this a new farm (yes, no), upload land ownership documents, upload land photos, Set Thumbnail image, Phone number, Registration Date(don’t display on UI but use the date they register) and Farm status(Don’t display on UI but Registered(default), Approved, Rejected, Updated and Damaged)  after submitting they are redirected to their profile where they keep track of their farm
5. Profile page: A farmer profile page has: Image, full name, username, Number of farm, Total land mass, Total Carbon credit yield(lifetime), Credit balance(user can spend credit yield so display balance left), Total farms verified(if a verifier), Total Verifier Credit yield(if a verifier), Verifier Credit yield balance(if a verifier),  Bio, profile edit icon(To take the user to the page to edit their profile and password reset). After this display the farmer the list of his farms.(just like farm list in dashboard but this is specific to the farmer logged in here).
6. Farm details page: This is where users are redirected to when they clicked on a farm list card: which displayed the details and information specific to a farm at the top of this page display the farm image, farm name, landmass, credit yield, registration number(the farm ID), registration date, farm owner username and status of the farm, (Display a tag (your Farm) and a functional edit icon at the top right if the user is the owner of the farm and when it’s clicked a modal pop up to edit the farm name and image and save it). And under this let have a horizontal nav toggle to check this specific info of the farm: (Activity, Review and comments). Under activities tab wanna have a comment box(text, image or video comment), This comment box in activity tab should only be visible to the farm owner and users with verifier role, and already commented messages should display on top of the comment box. Under Review tab wanna have the google map image (using map) of the farm location, farm land images and the land ownership documents inputed durind farm registration and under this display 2 buttons ( Update farm parameters, Damaged and Delete Farm) this button is only visible to farm owner and verifier which when Update farm parameters button is clicked pop a modal for farmer or verifier to update farm landmass(lenght and width) If updated by a virifier farm status should be changed to Approved but if updated by farm owner status should be changed to Updated and when Damage button is clicked pop a modal to give a notice that credit yield will stop and a confirm button on the modal to set farm status to damaged, Also when Delete farm is clicked pop a modal to display notice that this farm will be completely deleted on the platform and a confirm delete button that delete the farm parmanently. Under Comment tab wanna have a comment box(text, image), This comment box in Comment tab should be visible to every logged in users and every can make comment here, and already commented messages should display on top of the comment box, and under the comment box let have a red button report farm (Which should pop a modal (with input: reporter name, mail and report text and submit report button) for people to report the farm if anything is wong)
7. Verifier Farm list page: This is an different page from dashboard this is a page for verifier to view and verify farm. (Add a nav list: Verify Farms) which leads here and in the page wanna have filters for verifirers to filter farm by (recent, date range, hierarchy in terms of high to low or low to high based on yield and landmass respectively. And a search bar to search a farm. Farm list cards display: (farm image, name, landmass, cardon credit yield, Registration No(Their Id no), Registration Date, farmer username) and at the top right of the card i wanna display the farm status in a tag (Registered, Rejected, Updated and Damaged ) Note: Farm status with Approved must not display in this list.
8. Wallet page: Here is the place to track balance or Cabon credit and verifier credit (if verifier). Wanna display a table 3 columns (token, Balance, USD equivalent) and in the row i wanna list this token. Hbar, ERECO(that the name of the carbon credit yield) and VERECO (that the name of the verifier credit). Fetch the balance of ERECO and VERECO  from the backend. Under the table display 3 buttons (Deposit, Transfer and swap) this 3 button should pop a modal. And help me work on the modal just like a crypto transfer and swap modal. For deposit display the usernam and a copy icon at the left to copy the username. Under this help me code a transaction table.

Backend update:
1. The farm status must automatically change to Updated after ever 3 months.
2. Note Verifier credit yield is a balance different from Carbon credit yield balance. Those are 2 different field and figures
3. Set a 100meter length and 100meter width = 10 carbon credit per 24hours. Now use this static figure to caculate carbon credit yield and the yield will start to count and continue counting only if a farm status is Approved.
4. Set 1 verification = 50 Verifier credit. And use this to calculate Verifier balance. Once a verifier performs any action on any farm, that means any change of status on any farm (Approved, Rejected or Damage) count 1+ and update balance.

For the project structure. let the frontend files be at the root while you create a folder named backend to code my backend in there.

And please integrate the backend APIs perfectly in my frontend. and make all working.
